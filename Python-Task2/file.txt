Q1. Why is list used?
Ans1: List is quite like array that is used to store multiple data … 
 But unlike array list is dynamic , mutable and can store multiple data type like (string,tuple,int) in a single list , 
using nested list formation … Working with list is way more simple and efficient when compared to arrays in c .
A list, in Python, is mutable. 
Meaning you can change its value in memory without changing its address. 
One of the reasons why lists are useful is that you can directly append an element in a list, also that lists in Python don’t need to have a rigid data type. 
This means that you can have a string as well as an int in a list at the same time.
